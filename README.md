# Banisher Wow classic UI setup and healing strategy

<!-- @import "[TOC]" {cmd="toc" depthFrom=1 depthTo=6 orderedList=false} -->

## Overview

I tought that I will share how i configured my interface and what spells I use in different conditions.

**NOTE:** This page covers only raid healing in Classic World of Warcraft.

## Addons

My UI looks like this: !TODO!

### Raid frames

The most critical addon is the raid frame addon, which from my perspective has to offer **visibility** and it is really
important that you have to see if someone is affected by multiple dispellable and/or curable debuffs. The important debuffs should also be visible.

I chose the Aptchetka addon, which manages to suffice all my major requirements. It is a bit limited in configurability
but I found out that it meets my requirements both in looks and in features.

Automatically comes with pretty handy features built in such as heal communications and renew & PWS tracking, where you can see how much time / absorbtion remained.

It also can track missing buffs, such as PW:F/PoF and DS/PoS.
